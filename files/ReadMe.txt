Program Dev State
- Finished
- Correct last assignment maze winner file (now it sorts correctly)
- Instead of movement struct created position struct used in gameSymbol base class therefore inherited by the
subclasses, and therefore use it to update the gameSymbols movement
- Maze class developed ( fully working but player pointer wasn't updated so SIGSEV error showed up, to late to solve )

Main difficulties
- Maze class implemented successfully, but due to a pointer problem couldn't use it in the program
(problem will be solved in my gitHub one day after the delivery)
